/// The Cayley PRNG, named after the mathematician Arthur Cayley (1821â€“1895)
/// pictured above, uses a pair of generators of a symmetric group to generate
/// pseudorandom permutations which are then converted to pseudorandom numbers.
/// Cayley's Theorem states that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the
/// symmetric group acting on the group, which implies that symmetric groups have
/// a rich structure. The Cayley PRNG exploits this rich structure as a source of
/// pseudorandomness.
///
/// Compiling the Code
/// ==================
///
/// Windows and Visual Studio
/// -------------------------
///
/// A Visual Studio solution file **PRNG.sln** has been provided in the
/// root folder. It has been tested with Visual Studio 2019 Community under Windows 10.
///
/// Unix and g++
/// ------------
///
/// A **make** file has been placed in the **Code** directory. Type
/// "make generator" to create the executable file **generate.exe**. It has been
/// tested with g++ 7.4 on the Ubuntu 18.04.1 subsystem under Windows 10.
///
/// Running the Code
/// ================
///
/// Running **generator.exe** will perform a time-test on Cayley32
/// versus the Mersenne Twister with a preset seed.
/// Optional switches are as follows:
///
/// <center>
/// <table>
///   <tr>
///     <td><center><b>Switch</b></center></td>
///     <td><center><b>Description</b></center></td>

///       Generate an infinite number of pseudorandom bits from Cayley32
///       to stdout.
